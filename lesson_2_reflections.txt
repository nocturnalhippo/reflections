Lesson 2 Reflections:

1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a .git subfolder in the directory where all the tracked changes (atomic) is done.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory - where changes are made and done
Staging area - zone where you bundle the working files in the directory to be committed
Repository - 'uploaded' files into a logical commit

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Staging area lists all the files that you'll commit to the repository. In essense, it gives a checkpoint to see what you'll commit per logical change before sending it to the repo.
