1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a .git subfolder in the directory where all the tracked changes (atomic) is done.

Working directory - where changes are made and done
Staging area - zone where you bundle the working files in the directory to be committed
Repository - 'uploaded' files into a logical commit
